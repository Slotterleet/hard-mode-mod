# Hard Mode for Mindustry
This mod makes campaign and the whole Mindustry gameplay harder. If you are a novice, don't download this mod.
## What's Changed
### Blocks
- Turrets and mech pads are twice as expensive as the normal cost
- Unit factories now require triple resources to build units
- Draug factories cost double copper and lead and require 6 silicon to make the miners
- Power generators generate 2/3 of the basic generated amount (doesn't affect solar panels)
### Units
- _All_ units have double health
